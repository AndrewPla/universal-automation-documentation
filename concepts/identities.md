# Identities

Identities are the users or services connecting to your UA server. Identities are generated when you either create an AppToken via `Grant-UAAppToken` or when syncing with git. An Identity will be created based on the committer for a particular git commit. 

## Getting Identities

To retrieve Identities, use the `Get-UAIdentity` .
